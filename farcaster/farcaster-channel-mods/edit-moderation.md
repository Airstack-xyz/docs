# ⚙️ Edit Moderation

If you would like to make edits on the moderations settings, then simply go back to your **Channel Owner** dashboard and click on the **Edit Moderation** button on the channel that you prefer to edit:

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that you are logged in with the Airstack account that is connected to the Farcaster account that own the channel.
{% endhint %}

If you would like to apply the new moderation rules on your Farcaster channel, then make sure to **Sweep**. Learn more how to sweep [here](manual-sweep.md).
