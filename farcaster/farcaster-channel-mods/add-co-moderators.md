If you would like to add co-moderators to your channel moderation, then simply go back to your **Channel Owner** dashboard and click on the **Edit Moderation** button on the channel that you prefer to edit:

Then, you will be redirected to the channel moderation settings page. Here you will find an input bar in the **Always Include** box section where you can add co-moderators:

Once, you're done simply click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page and all the casts liked by the co-moderators will be included as part of your channel feed.

In addition, your co-moderators will have access to moderate the cast manually using the [Not A Bot Cast Action](not-a-bot-cast-action.md).
