# ðŸ«‚ Add Co-Moderators

If you would like to add co-moderators to your channel moderation, then simply go back to your **Channel Owner** dashboard and click on the **Edit Moderation** button on the channel that you prefer to edit:

{% hint style="info" %}
Ensure that you are logged in with the Airstack account that is connected to the Farcaster account that own the channel.
{% endhint %}

Then, you will be redirected to the channel moderation settings page. Here you will find an input bar in the **Always Include** box section where you can input up to 5 co-moderators:

Once, you're done simply click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page and all the casts liked by the co-moderators will be included as part of your channel feed.
