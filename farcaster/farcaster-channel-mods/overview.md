# ℹ️ Overview

## Moderation Options

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Channel Moderation Options</p></figcaption></figure>

You can moderate your channels using any of the following criteria:

* [Social Capital Rank](../../abstractions/trending-casts/social-capital-value-and-social-capital-scores.md)
* Power Badge
* Is Followed by Channel Owner
* Follows Channel Owner
* Has a certain NFT
* Has a certain amount of a token
* \> X Followers
* Has in person POAPs (attended in-person events)
* Has certain POAPs
* Has a POAP
* FID < X (for the OGs)

To make it easy for you we’ve created 3 default options for auto-including casts tagged into the channel:

1. from users you follow
2. from users with the Farcaster Power Badge (\~5k top users)
3. from users with Social Capital Rank <10,000. These are the 10k most influential members on the Farcaster network.

if you want to start with the defaults, all you need to do is click the **Save** button.

You can edit/delete the suggested defaults as you prefer and add other rules as needed.

Additionally, you can also choose to require either 'any' or 'all' of the rules to be met. For best practice, we recommend using **any**.

## Roadmap

The following features are still in development for the channel moderation:

* Backfill all previous casts and apply the rules in moderated Main channel feed (Friday)
* Ban user
* Unlike cast
* Mod Cast Actions
* Add all channel casts these “faux-moderator” users like
* Logs
* Analytics
* CRM
* Channel Passes
* Channel ownership sharing
* Revenue sharing amongst pass holders
* DAO-like features

If you need any other rule, feel free to [let us know in the Airstack channel on Warpcast](https://warpcast.com/\~/channel/airstack).
