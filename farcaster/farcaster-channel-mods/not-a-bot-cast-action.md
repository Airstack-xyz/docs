# üèá Not A Bot Cast Action

The **Not A Bot** cast action is an easy-to-use cast action that **you (channel owner)** and [**your co-moderators**](add-co-moderators.md) can setup within minutes to easily moderate your moderated channel manually.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you have would like to add co-moderators to your channel, follow this guide [here](add-co-moderators.md).
{% endhint %}

To get started, first install the **Not A Bot** cast action with the link below:

{% embed url="https://warpcast.com/~/add-cast-action?url=https://frames.airstack.xyz/mc/action" %}
Not A Bot Cast Action Link
{% endembed %}

Once the cast action is installed successfully, a green popup will appear on top of Warpcast to indicate that your Farcaster account is ready to use the cast action.

Now that you have the **Not A Bot** cast action, go to the channel that you own and select any cast in your moderated channel that you would like to manually moderate.

In the cast, you can select the **Not A Bot** cast action:

Once the cast action is clicked, it will initially show you a Frame that provide you extensive information of the caster, including:

* number of followers of the caster
* [social capital rank](../../abstractions/trending-casts/social-capital-value-and-social-capital-scores.md) of the caster
* check if the caster is followed by the owner
* check if the caster is following the owner
* check if the caster follow the Farcaster channel

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-06-03 at 11.11.55.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Within the displayed Farcaster Frame as shown above, you will have two options to either:

* **Allow & like**: This button will allow you to whitelist a user. By whitelisting a user, all future casts from the user will be included in the moderated Farcaster channel casts.
* **Ban User**: This button will ban the user from the moderation. Consequently, this will exclude all of the user's casts from being displayed in the moderated Farcaster channel feed.
