## Features

Airstack's Frame analytics enables you to:

* Consolidate usage data from multiple Frames and cast actions
* Track user engagement on Frames and cast actions at the subdomain level
* Access detailed analytics for individual Frames and cast actions

This feature is available to you for **FREE** and usage is tracked using our Frames Validator.

To integrate our **FREE** Frames Validator into your Frames, make sure that you have your Farcaster account connected to your Airstack account and follow [this tutorial](frames-validator.md) for the step-by-step integration.
