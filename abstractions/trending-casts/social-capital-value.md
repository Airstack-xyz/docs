# ðŸ˜Ž Social Capital Value

Social Capital Value (SCV) is a metric developed by Airstack to identify high-quality Trending Casts on Farcaster. \
\
The SCV of a cast is determined through the following process:

* Each Farcaster user is assigned a Social Capital Score (SCS), which quantifies their positive impact on the platform. This score is derived from a variety of onchain criteria. Users with higher SCSs have more positive downstream influence, as their actions and engagements tends to result in higher quality overall engagement. Currently, the SCS is powered by a proprietary algorithm from Airstack. This algorithm is kept confidential to prevent manipulation. Over time, we aim to refine the SCS based on its performance and eventually release it as an open-source protocol.
* The SCS of a user impacts the SCV of a cast when the user engages with it. The nature of the engagement also plays a role. The accumulated SCS of all interactions contributes to the cast's overall SCV. Casts are then ranked by their SCV, promoting higher-quality casts.

This methodology ensures that the most impactful casts are highlighted on Farcaster, fostering a constructive community environment.
