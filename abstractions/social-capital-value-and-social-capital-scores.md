* Every Farcaster Member earns a **Far Score** based on their relative influence in the Farcaster network (formerly known as "Social Capital Score"). Far Scores are dynamic (constantly updating) and ever-increasing. There are no negative factors affecting Far Scores.\

* Every cast and reply on Farcaster earns a **Cast Score** based on the Far Scores of the users who engage with the content and the type of engagement.

Airstack also publishes the **Far Rank** for each Farcaster Member (formerly Social Capital Rank) which ranks all members from 1 to N based on their Far Scores. Member with rank 1 has the highest Far Score, 2 has second highest Far Score, etc, etc.)



You can fetch the Far Score (SCS), Cast Score (SCV), and Far Rank (SCR) [via the Airstack APIs](https://app.airstack.xyz).
