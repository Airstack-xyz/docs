# üóùÔ∏è Get API Key

## Step 1: Create An Airstack Account

Go to [Airstack Dashboard](https://app.airstack.xyz) and click `Sign In` on the top-right corner of the page.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you do not have an account with Airstack, this will **create a new Airstack account** for you.

Otherwise, it will login to your existing Airstack account.
{% endhint %}

A login popup will appear for you:

You have several options to login:

* **Email & Social**
  * Email (passwordless)
  * Google
  * GitHub
  * Farcaster
* **Connect Wallet**
  * Metamask
  * Coinbase Wallet
  * WalletConnect

## Step 2: Complete Account Setup

Input your desired **Username**, **Project name**, and **Telegram** to complete your profile:

In addition, if you are logging in with a non-Farcaster method, make sure that you **have connected a Farcaster custodial or verified wallet** to your Airstack account.

## Step 3: Get API Key

{% hint style="info" %}
To keep access for your Airstack API key, make sure that you **have at least 1 /airstack Channel Fan Token** in your Farcaster custodial or verified wallet.

You will have API key access as long as you hold the /airstack channel Fan Token.

If you don't have it yet, you can buy it [here](https://www.airstack.xyz/channels/airstack).

Owning the /airstack channel Fan Token does not guarantee access to the Airstack API.
{% endhint %}

Once everything is set up, go to the settings page by hovering your mouse to the **Profile icon** on the top right and click [**Profile settings**](https://app.airstack.xyz/profile-settings/profile).

Then, simply click the 3rd entry on the sidebar, [**View API Keys**](https://app.airstack.xyz/profile-settings/api-keys), and copy your **Prod API key**.
