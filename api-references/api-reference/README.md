# 📖 API Reference

Airstack uniquely enables complex queries/responses across multiple on-chain and off-chain data sources.\\

Here are some high-level pointers:\\

**The** [**Airstack** **Identity API**](airstack-identity-api.md) has been integrated throughout all of the GraphQL queries! You can filter your queries using identity fields such as address, ENS, Farcaster, and more.

[**Nested Queries**](../overview/nested-queries.md) enable you to query across the entire data set from any of the APIs. This allows you to write complex simultaneous queries/responses all-at-once vs. having to daisy-chain multiple queries.

[**Logical comparators & complex queries**](../overview/working-with-graphql.md)

In GraphQL, logical comparators like \_and , \_nor, and \_or are used to combine multiple filtering conditions, allowing you to create more complex queries.
