# 📖 API Reference

Airstack uniquely enables complex queries/responses across multiple on-chain and off-chain data sources.\


Here are some high-level pointers:\


**The Airstack** [**Identity API**](broken-reference) has been integrated throughout all of the GraphQL queries! You can filter your queries using identity fields such as address, ENS, Farcaster, and more.

**Nested Queries** enable you to query across the entire data set from any of the APIs. This allows you to write complex simultaneous queries/responses all-at-once vs. having to daisy-chain multiple queries.&#x20;

[**Logical comparators & complex queries**](broken-reference)

In GraphQL, logical comparators like \_and , \_nor, and \_or are used to combine multiple filtering conditions, allowing you to create more complex queries.&#x20;
