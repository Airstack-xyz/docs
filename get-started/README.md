description: Web3 data APIs for developers

# â„¹ Overview

### TL/DR

Instantly integrate on-chain and off-chain data into any application.

Airstack is a web3 developer platform that provides powerful APIs for integrating on-chain and off-chain data into any application. With Airstack developers are able to easily connect their applications to the web3 ecosystem.

Airstack enables queries that combine on-chain and off-chain data from multiple sources in a single response. Our goal is to enable developers to query and integrate relevant web3 data and serve it up to users without requiring heavy infrastructure or even a back-end.

Airstack Identity Resolver (AIR) APIs map addresses and transactions across various web3 identities including ENS, Farcaster, Lens, specific Dapps, and NFT Marketplaces.

ðŸ¤– Airstack AI enables natural languages searches -- a great way to get started and learn the APIs.

### Key Features&#x20;

* **GraphQL APIs.** Get the exact data you need in easy-to-integrate formats; no back-end  required.
* **AI.** Query with natural language. No code required to get started.&#x20;
* **Complex made easy.** Query across multiple projects, wallets, and blockchains, and combine on-chain and off-chain data in a single response.
* **Identity APIs.** Map addresses and transactions across various sources, including ENS, Farcaster, Lens, Dapps, and Marketplaces.
* **Snapshots.** Query historical data, balances, and transfers, within the time range or length of holding. (launching June 2023)
* **Collaboration built-in.** Browse, remix, or fork from a public marketplace of queries and APIs

### More details for developers

* Access every on-chain transaction since the genesis block along with dapp-specific events and NFT marketplace data
* Simultaneously query and combine on-chain and off-chain data
* Powerful features such as resized NFT media, date snapshots, comparators, ENS, primary ENS, Farcaster, Lens, and more
* Leverage the power of GraphQL, more advanced than Rest APIs: Get just the data you require in single-complex-queries
* Integrate into any web2/3 app without any additional infrastructure
* Webhooks for streaming updates (coming soon)
* Open source schemas and APIs for adding additional data, dapps, and protocols into Airstack
* Get started today with Ethereum and Polygon. More blockchains coming soon
