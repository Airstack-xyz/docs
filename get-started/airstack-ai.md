{% hint style="info" %}
Currently, Airstack AI is only available in Airstack API studio. In the future, we'll have this offered as an API service.
{% endhint %}

## Best Practices

To get the best out of the feature, here are some best practices to follow:

### Tip #1: Be Specific And Clear On Inputs

Start with the input and make it clear what's the input. For example:

* For Farcaster user [dwr](https://explorer.airstack.xyz/token-balances?address=fc\_fname%3Adwr\&blockchain=ethereum\&rawInput=%23%E2%8E%B1fc\_fname%3Adwr%E2%8E%B1%28fc\_fname%3Adwr++ethereum+null%29\&inputType=ADDRESS), show their web3 socials and NFTs
* For [vitalik.eth](https://explorer.airstack.xyz/token-balances?address=vitalik.eth\&blockchain=ethereum\&rawInput=%23%E2%8E%B1vitalik.eth%E2%8E%B1%28vitalik.eth++ethereum+null%29\&inputType=ADDRESS), show their POAPs

### Tip #2: Use Airstack Token Selector

Use `@` to choose from a list of 10,000 popular Tokens, NFTs, and POAP events

If you are looking for a project that is not yet in our auto-complete @mention list, please [let us know](https://t.me/+uW6ypo49TcZmMGEx) in the developer Telegram group. In meantime, you can always enter a contract address.

### Tip #3: Use _/help_
