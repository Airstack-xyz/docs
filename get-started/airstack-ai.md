# ðŸ¤– Airstack AI

ðŸ¤– ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!&#x20;

Iâ€™m an AI assistant that knows everything about the Airstack APIs.&#x20;

I can help you write queries and get the APIs you need.

I currently support the following blockchains: Ethereum. Polygon. I have access to the entire histories as well as new transactions within seconds.

Iâ€™m also really strong on web3 identities, token balances, and collectibles.\
I can retrieve ENS, Farcaster, Lens, POAPs, NFT collection holders, and ERC-20 balances.

I also have access to all sales data from OpenSea, Blur, Rarible.\
\
And I can retrieve resized NFT images in 4 different sizes.&#x20;

Hereâ€™s a tip. If you type â€œ@â€œ in the entry box you can choose from over 5000 tokens, NFT collections and POAPs by name. If you donâ€™t find the one you are looking for you can always enter a contract address.

If you are looking for a project that is not yet in our auto-complete @mention list, please [let us know](https://t.me/+uW6ypo49TcZmMGEx) in the developer Telegram group. In meantime you can always enter a contract address.

### Here are some example questions you can ask me:
