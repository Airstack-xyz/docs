## After September 18, 2023

Airstack API will be charged accordingly to the following guidelines:

### Free to Start

It will cost you $0 to experiment, plan, and explore the Airstack APIs in totality. \
A very generous free tier ($500 worth of free usage) will be provided to all developers.

### No Pay-Walled Features

All API features should be available to you, regardless of your pricing tier.

### Pay Only For What You Use

You will pay according to the value received, as measured in **API calls/responses**.&#x20;

After the initial free tier the pricing will be roughly as follows, based on usage:

| Usage Tiers               | Price Range/Month (USD)\* |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Startups                  | 10-250                    |
| Small Business            | 250 - 1,000               |
| Medium                    | 1,000 - 4,999             |
| Large/Enterprise Business | 5000 - 25,000/custom      |
