# ðŸ”‹ Pricing

## Before Mid-October 2023

[Airstack](https://airstack.xyz) is available **free of charge** until mid-October 2023. (exact launch date tbd).

Our focus right now is to help developers achieve their desired use cases while we learn together and rapidly enhance the [Airstack](https://airstack.xyz) features.

If you need a rate limit increase, you can request one on your Dashboard's [Manage Billing](https://app.airstack.xyz/profile-settings/manage-plans) page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**The only exception prior to October is Enterprise** usage, currently defined as having >50,000,000 API calls per month, who are subject to immediate custom pricing.
{% endhint %}

## After Mid-October 2023

Airstack API use will be charged accordingly to the following guidelines:

### 1. Free to Start

* It will cost users $0 to experiment, plan, and explore the Airstack APIs in totality.&#x20;
* A very generous free bundle of credits (X millions) will be provided to all users&#x20;
* Many users will be able to make use of the free credits for many months before encountering any charges. The intent is to only charge for scaling production apps.&#x20;

### 2. No Pay-Walled Features

* All API features will be available to all developers at all times
* Unlimited use of Airstack AI for all users
* All devs will get a high rate limit: 3000 requests per minute, bursts of 300 per second

### 3. Pay Only For What You Use

* After you've exhausted your free credits, you will pay for to the value you are receiving, as measured in **API calls/responses**.&#x20;
* Each API request will cost a # of **credits** depending on the number of nested API calls/variables in the query.&#x20;
  * A simple query with 1 input and 1 response variable = 1 credit. So, you would have to run that query millions of times to exhaust your free credits.&#x20;
  * We'll provide a series of examples, simple calculators and in-app reports -- so you can build with confidence at all times
* After the initial free credits, each additional credit will cost $0.00002, billed weekly based on your actual usage.&#x20;
* There are no flat or minimum monthly flat fees. You only pay for what you use.&#x20;
