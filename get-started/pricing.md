# ðŸ”‹ Pricing

## Before October 2023

[Airstack](https://airstack.xyz) is available **free of charge** for hackers, professionals, startups, and for all normal business use cases until October 2023.

Our focus right now is to help developers achieve their desired use cases while we learn together and rapidly enhance the [Airstack](https://airstack.xyz) features.

If you need a rate limit increase, you can request one on your Dashboard's [Manage Billing](https://app.airstack.xyz/profile-settings/manage-plans) page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**The only exception prior to October is Enterprise** usage, currently defined as having >50,000,000 API calls per month, who are subject to immediate custom pricing.
{% endhint %}

## After October 2023

Airstack API use will be charged accordingly to the following guidelines:

### Free to Start

* It will cost users $0 to experiment, plan, and explore the Airstack APIs in totality.&#x20;
* A very generous free bundle of credits (X millions) will be provided to all users&#x20;
* Many users will be able to make use of the free credits for many months before encountering any charges. The intent is to only charge for scaling apps.&#x20;

### No Pay-Walled Features

* All API features will be available to all developers at all times

### Pay Only For What You Use

* You will pay according to the value you are receiving, as measured in **API calls/responses**.&#x20;
* Each API request will cost a # of credits depending on the number of nested API calls/variables in the query. A simple query with 1 input and 1 response variable = 1 credit. So, you would have to run that query millions of times to exhaust your free credits.&#x20;
* There are no monthly flat fees. You only pay for what you use.&#x20;
* After the initial free credits, each additional credit will cost $0.00002, billed weekly based on actual usage.&#x20;
