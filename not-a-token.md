# ðŸ˜¶ Not A Token

\
[Not A Token](https://airstack.xyz/notatoken) is a points system that rewards the Farcaster community for creating great content and Farcaster developers for building great apps with Airstack. The following rewards are currently available:

* Earn 1 Not A Token for every 1 Social Capital Value your cast receives.&#x20;
  * Social Capital Value (SCV) is a metric created by Airstack that measures the influences of the Farcaster users who engage with each cast. Learn more about SCV [here](https://docs.airstack.xyz/airstack-docs-and-faqs/abstractions/trending-casts/social-capital-value).&#x20;
  * Not A Token for Cast applies to all SCV earned from 1-May, 2024 onwards. Older casts can still earn SCV from new engagement, however SCV received by casts prior to 1-May 2024 does not carry over.&#x20;
* Earn 10,000 Not A Token the first time you run an API call with Airstack. A connected Farcaster account is required. To sign up, click [here](https://app.airstack.xyz).
* Earn 100 Not A Token every time a unique Farcaster user uses your Frames. You must use the [Airstack Frame Validator (free)](farcaster/farcaster-frames/frames-validator.md) in order for us to track and associate the usage.
* Earn Not A Token whenever you swap tokens through Airstack Swap Frames or whenever someone swaps from a Airstack Swap Frame you share. [Learn more and create and share a Swap Frame](https://airstack.xyz/notatoken).&#x20;
